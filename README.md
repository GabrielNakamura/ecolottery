Coalescent-based simulation of ecological communities

This package allows quick and efficient simulation of communities undergoing both neutral and niche-based assembly processes. We also provide an Approximate Bayesian Computation tool to assess parameters of these processes from observed communities.
We propose a coalescent-based approach that presents significant advantages over alternative algorithms, allowing intensive calculation schemes. It does not require simulating community dynamics from an initial state forward in time, and the genealogical approach can incorporate the influence of environmental filtering and species niche differences. The sampling process allows simulating varying sample size in a flexible way.
